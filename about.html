       <h2>What is Quantum Computing?</h2>
       <p>The fundamental basis of quantum computation is Landauer’s observation that all information is
        ultimately physical [1, 2]. Information, the 1's and 0's of classical computers, must inevitably be
        recorded by some physical system - be it paper or silicon. Which brings us to the key point. As far as
        we know today, all matter is composed of atoms - nuclei and electrons - and the interactions and time
        evolution of atoms are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Although the peculiarities of the
        quantum world may not seem readily apparent at first glance, a closer look reveals that applications
        of quantum mechanics are all around us (see for example Ref. [3]). As has been emphasized by
        Minsky [4], the very existence of atoms owes everything not to the chaotic uncertainties of classical
        mechanics, but rather to the certainties of quantum mechanics with the Pauli exclusion principle and
        well-defined and stable atomic energy levels! Indeed without our quantum understanding of the solid
        state and the band theory of metals, insulators and semiconductors, the whole of the semiconductor
        industry with its transistors and integrated circuits - and hence the computer on which I am writing
        this lecture - could not have developed. The same can be said about quantum optics and lasers: huge
        industries - from optical communications to music and video CDs - have their basis in these
        intrinsically quantum technologies.
        <br><br>
        At bottom then, everything is quantum mechanical and, like Feynman in his visionary 1959
        ‘Plenty of Room at the Bottom’ talk [5], we can certainly envisage storing bits of information on
        single atoms or electrons. However, these microscopic objects do not obey Newton's Laws of
        classical mechanics: instead, they evolve and interact according to the Schroedinger equation, the
        ‘Newton's Law’ of quantum mechanics. In fact, we know now that even this is only a suitable
        approximation for everyday speeds and energies: at high speeds and energies, we must use the Dirac
        <br><br>
        equation and Einstein's relativity, with its predictions of relativistic mass increase and particle-
        antiparticle creation, must be taken into account. However, for most of our everyday concerns, it is
        <br><br>
        safe for us to ignore these complications and use the non-relativistic version of quantum mechanics
        embodied by Schroedinger's equation.
        Information is ultimately not an abstract concept - it must be recorded and stored on media that
        are fundamentally quantum mechanical. We must therefore broaden our definition of information as
        merely a string of 1's and 0's and examine the consequences of the quantum nature of media for
        information. The implications of this new field of quantum information theory are still being
        explored and may yet deliver more surprises. However, to introduce quantum computing, we shall
        only need a few quantum concepts and principles. But before we turn to a discussion of qubits and
        the like, we must now make an apparently puzzling diversion and introduce some ideas of Ed Fredkin
        and Charles Bennett about reversible computing and reversible logic gates.</p>

        <h3>Complexity</h3>
        <p>Complexity is the study of algorithms. The ‘universality’ of Turing Machines makes it possible for
            computer scientists to classify algorithms into different ‘complexity classes’. For example,
            multiplication of two N x N matrices requires an operation count that grows like N
            <br><br>
            3 with the size of
            the matrix. This can be analysed in detail for a simple Turing machine implementation of the
            algorithm. However, the important point about ‘universality’ is that although you may be able to
            multiply matrices somewhat faster than on a Turing machine, you cannot change from an N
            3<br>
            growth
            of operations no matter what Pentium chip or special purpose matrix multiply hardware you choose
            to use. Thus algorithms, such as matrix multiply, for which execution time and resources grow
            polynomially with problem size, are said to be ‘tractable’ and in the complexity class ‘P’. Algorithms<br>
            for which time and resources are found to grow exponentially with problem size are said to be
            ‘intractable’. There are many subtleties to this classification scheme: the famous ‘Travelling
            Salesperson Problem’, for example, is in the rather mysterious complexity class ‘NP’. The book by
            David Harel [12] contains an excellent introduction to this subject.
            What has this to do with quantum information and quantum computers? In 1985 David
            Deutsch pointed out that since a quantum computer was not a Turing machine there was the
            possibility of new complexity classification of algorithms [13]. As we will see, quantum computers
            evolve a coherent superposition of quantum states so that each of these states could follow a distinct<br>
            computational path until a final measurement is made at the output. It is therefore certainly
            conceptually possible that at least for some problems, quantum computers could surpass the power of
            classical Turing computers. The first speculation that this might be so is probably due to Feynman in
            1981 [14].<br><br> However, it was not until 1994 that interest in this subject exploded after Peter Shor's
            discovery of a new quantum algorithm for factorizing large numbers [15].
            Mathematicians believe (although it has yet to be proved) that the number of steps required on
            a classical computer to factorize a number with N decimal digits grows exponentially with N. Since
            the computational work required grows very rapidly, the difficulty of factorizing very large numbers<br>
            has been made the basis of the security of the RSA encryption method (see Ref. [13] for a good
            review of encryption techniques). This system is widely used to protect electronic bank accounts, for<br>
            example. The significance of Shor's result was that his algorithm, running on a quantum computer,
            could solve the factorization problem in polynomial time. What this could mean for the RSA
            cryptographic system may be illustrated by the time required to factorize a 129 digit number known
            as RSA129 [16]. In 1994 this required 5000 MIPS-years of computer time to factorize into its 64 and
            65 bit prime factors, using over 1000 workstations over a period of 8 months. A quantum computer
            using Shor's algorithm with a clock speed of 100 MHz could factor RSA129 in a few seconds. This
            explains the interest of various ‘secret’ government agencies around the world in the feasibility of
            building quantum computers!</p>
