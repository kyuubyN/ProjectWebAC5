            <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
                Quantum mechanics is the theory that describes the behavior of microscopic
                systems, such as photons, electrons, atoms, molecules, etc.

                Nobody understands quantum mechanics!

                “No, you’re not going to be able to understand it.... You see, my physics
                students don’t understand it either. That is because I don’t understand it.
                Nobody does. ... The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature
                as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with
                an experiment. So I hope that you can accept Nature as She is – absurd”

            <h3>QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING</h3>
            <p>Quantum computers promise to solve biologically relevant problems, like predicting protein–ligand
                interactions or understanding coevolution of amino acids in proteins, exponentially faster than any
                current computer. This paradigm shift, however, requires a fundamental change in our thinking: quantum
                computers are very different from their classical analogues. <br><br><br>The physical phenomena that
                underpin quantum advantage are often counter-intuitive and defy common sense, and utilizing a quantum
                processor requires fundamental changes in the way we understand programming. In this section, we
                introduce the principles of quantum information and how it is processed to perform computation. We
                explain how information works differently in a quantum system, where it is stored in qubits, and how
                this information may be manipulated using quantum gates. Like the variables and functions of a
                programming language, qubits and quantum gates establish the basic components of any algorithm. We also
                discuss why building a quantum computer is technically challenging, and what may be achieved with the
                early prototypes that are expected in the coming years. This introduction will cover only the basic
                requirements; for a comprehensive introduction see Nielsen and Chuang.</p>

            <h3 style="padding-top: 100px;">STATISTICAL METHODS AND MACHINE LEARNING</h3>
            <p>In computational biology, where the objective is often to assimilate vast amounts of data, statistical
                methods and machine learning are key techniques. For example, in genomics, annotation of gene
                information has made extensive use of hidden Markov models (HMMs); in drug discovery, a vast array of
                statistical models have been developed to estimate molecular properties, or to predict if a ligand will
                bind to a protein; and, in structural biology, deep neural networks have been used to both predict
                contacts, secondary structure and most recently 3D protein structures. Training and developing such
                models is often computationally intensive. A major catalyst of the recent advancements in machine
                learning was the realization that general purpose graphical processing units (GPUs) could significantly
                accelerate the training procedure. By providing exponentially faster algorithms to train machine
                learning models, quantum computing may provide a similar stimulus to scientific applications.
                <br><br><br>
                In thissection, we explain how quantum computing can accelerate numerous statistical learning methods.
                Our introduction is aimed at developments that are likely to be directly applicable in biology; for a
                wider treatment of quantum machine learning, see.</p>
