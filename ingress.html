            <h2>Want to work with quantum computing?</h2>
            <p>Because there’s plenty of training available, not to mention the on-the-job support from your peers.
                <br>
                So, if you want to start working with quantum computers, you don’t have to have any experience with these machines or in the wider field of quantum mechanics. You don’t even need a physics degree.
                <br>
                Likewise, if you’re a quantum expert and want to branch out into another area, then you can. We’ve helped quantum engineers train in classical computing fields because they want to know more about a specific engineering challenge or type of hardware.
                <br>
                Simply put, we don’t have tick boxes when evaluating candidates. Also, we want to hear from candidates at every stage of their careers. Don’t discount yourself just because you think you have too little experience or the wrong kind of experience. There’s no such thing!
                <br>
                What we’re looking for are candidates who can upskill and adapt. And remember, most quantum companies are start-ups so it’s more important to be able to multi-task and help where help is needed. We love people who come up with novel solutions, try new things and don’t limit their own potential.
                <br>
                Also, the field of quantum computing is still relatively young — we don’t know where it will ultimately end up, so agile candidates with multidisciplinary skills will always be in demand.</p>

        <h3>interview</h3>
        <p>When you get to the interview stage, don’t forget to interview with purpose and ask questions not only about the role but other areas of the business.
            <br>
            At Universal Quantum, for example, we’ve been focused on creating a million-qubit machine from day one. So, our technology takes a unique approach compared to other companies out there. We have a saying, “it’s one million qubits or nothing” because, to do anything useful with a quantum computer, we have to reach the million-qubit range.
            <br>
            We know it’s an ambitious goal and we love candidates who come with questions about our tech and business. When interviewing, I also tend to find out what a candidate’s interests are and match that to a need in the company.
            <br>
            Remember, this is your chance to ask us everything you need to be certain that we will be the right place for you both now, and as you grow and develop your career. We care deeply about your interests and ambitions and will be honest with you about the support, training and opportunities we can provide to help you realise them.
            <br>
            #4 We’re all learning on the job
            We’re working on one of the most incredible challenges, transforming the future of computing. We’re all learning and learning from each other as we grow both our technology and team.
            <br>
            That’s why it’s important to ask questions. At Universal Quantum, we value curiosity more than someone who has all the answers. In fact, the only thing that really concerns us is when our candidates or team don’t ask questions.
            <br>
            It’s also important for any candidate to ask questions to make sure a company is right for your career goals and how you learn. You want to work for a company that will support you and also have the adaptability to keep pace with your ambitions.</p>
